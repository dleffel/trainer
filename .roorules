# Roo Rules for TrainerApp Project

## Build Commands
- NEVER use `cd` to change directories when running xcodebuild
- Always use the `-project` flag with the full path from the current working directory
- Example: `xcodebuild -project TrainerApp/TrainerApp.xcodeproj -scheme TrainerApp build`

## File Operations
- All file paths should be relative to the current working directory (/Users/danielleffel/repos/trainer)
- Use proper relative paths when referencing files in subdirectories

## Project Structure
- Main project is in TrainerApp/ subdirectory
- Xcode project file is at TrainerApp/TrainerApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
- Source files are in TrainerApp/TrainerApp/

## Date Handling
- NEVER use Date() directly in views or managers when dealing with training schedules
- The TrainingScheduleManager may use simulated dates (e.g., program starts in the future)
- Always check if the current date is before/after the program start date
- Use the program's effective date when initializing calendar views

## Data Model Changes
- When adding new fields to WorkoutDay, StructuredWorkout, or other persisted models, ALWAYS update TrainingScheduleManager's clearProgram() method to ensure the new fields are properly cleared
- When adding new storage keys or persistence mechanisms, ensure they are included in all clear data operations
- Test that "Clear Workout Data" completely removes all traces of enhanced data structures

## Reminders
- Test builds without changing directories
- Maintain proper file path references
- Keep all operations relative to the workspace root
- Be aware of date simulation in training schedule contexts
- Always verify clear data functionality works completely when adding new model fields
