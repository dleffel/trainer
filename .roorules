# Roo Rules for TrainerApp Project

## Build Commands
- NEVER use `cd` to change directories when running xcodebuild
- Always use the `-project` flag with the full path from the current working directory
- Example: `xcodebuild -project TrainerApp/TrainerApp.xcodeproj -scheme TrainerApp build`

## File Operations
- All file paths should be relative to the current working directory (/Users/danielleffel/repos/trainer)
- Use proper relative paths when referencing files in subdirectories

## Project Structure
- Main project is in TrainerApp/ subdirectory
- Xcode project file is at TrainerApp/TrainerApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
- Source files are in TrainerApp/TrainerApp/

## Reminders
- Test builds without changing directories
- Maintain proper file path references
- Keep all operations relative to the workspace root
