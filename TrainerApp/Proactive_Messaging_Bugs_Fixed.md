# Proactive Messaging Bugs Fixed

## Bug 1: False Claims Without Tool Execution
**Issue**: LLM claimed "I've initialized your training program" without actually calling the required tools.

**Root Cause**: System prompt didn't explicitly require tool execution before making claims.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added "NEVER LIE ABOUT ACTIONS" rule to system prompt
- Made tool execution flow mandatory and explicit
- Added verification requirements in prompts

## Bug 2: Blank Messages Being Sent
**Issue**: Proactive messages were being sent but the message content was empty.

**Symptoms**:
```
Send: Yes
Reasoning: Program is initialized...
Message: 
```

**Root Cause**: The `parseCoachDecision` function only read content on the same line as "MESSAGE:" but LLM responses often have the message content on subsequent lines.

**Fix Applied**:
```swift
// Now captures multi-line messages
var isCapturingMessage = false
var messageLines: [String] = []

// Captures all lines after MESSAGE: until hitting another field
if trimmed.hasPrefix("MESSAGE:") {
    isCapturingMessage = true
    // Capture same-line content if exists
    let sameLineContent = String(trimmed.dropFirst(8))
    if !sameLineContent.isEmpty {
        messageLines.append(sameLineContent)
    }
}
```

**Debug Features Added**:
- Debug logging to show captured message lines
- Validation to prevent empty messages
- Proper multi-line message joining

## Bug 3: Missing Typing Indicators
**Issue**: When proactive service is processing, users don't see any indication in the app.

**Solution Designed**:
- Notification-based typing indicator system
- State-specific messages ("thinking", "preparing", etc.)
- Works whether app is foreground or background

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Explicit Prompts**: Always specify exact requirements for tool usage
2. **Multi-line Parsing**: Always consider that LLM responses may span multiple lines
3. **Debug Logging**: Add comprehensive logging for parsing operations
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for parsing functions with various response formats

## Benefits of Refactored Architecture

The modular architecture makes these bugs:
- **Easier to Find**: Issues isolated to specific components
- **Easier to Fix**: Changes don't affect unrelated functionality
- **Easier to Test**: Can unit test parsing logic in isolation
- **Easier to Prevent**: Clear interfaces and responsibilities

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Parse Testing**:
```swift
func testParseMultiLineMessage() {
    let response = """
    SEND: Yes
    REASONING: Time to send workout
    MESSAGE: Hello athlete!
    Today's workout is challenging.
    Let's get started!
    """
    
    let decision = parseCoachDecision(response)
    XCTAssertTrue(decision.message?.contains("Hello athlete!"))
    XCTAssertTrue(decision.message?.contains("Let's get started!"))
}
```

2. **Tool Execution Verification**:
```swift
func testNoClaimsWithoutTools() {
    // Verify message content matches executed tools
    let toolsExecuted = ["get_training_status"]
    let message = "I've initialized your program" // Should fail
    XCTAssertFalse(validateMessageClaims(message, toolsExecuted))
}
```

These fixes ensure the proactive messaging system is reliable and honest in its communications.
