# Adaptive Workout Planning Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented adaptive day-by-day workout planning with full CRUD operations while maintaining compatibility with the existing data model.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Tool Handlers in ToolProcessor.swift
Added five new adaptive planning tools:
- **`plan_workout`** - Plan a single day's workout
- **`update_workout`** - Modify an existing workout with reason tracking
- **`delete_workout`** - Remove a workout (converts to rest day)
- **`get_workout`** - Retrieve specific day's workout details
- **`plan_next_workout`** - Adaptively plan based on feedback

### 2. TrainingScheduleManager.swift Enhancements
Added single-day CRUD operations that work with existing WorkoutDay model:
- `planSingleWorkout()` - Creates/updates single day workouts
- `updateSingleWorkout()` - Modifies workouts with embedded reason
- `deleteSingleWorkout()` - Clears workouts or marks as rest
- `getWorkoutDay()` - Retrieves specific day's data
- `getNextTrainingDate()` - Finds next non-rest day
- `generateAdaptiveWorkout()` - Creates workouts based on feedback

### 3. SystemPrompt.md Updates
Replaced rigid weekly planning with adaptive daily protocol:
- Changed from batch weekly planning to day-by-day approach
- Added adaptive planning rules based on athlete feedback
- Documented new tool usage patterns
- Kept `plan_week_workouts` for backward compatibility but marked as deprecated

## How It Works Without Data Model Changes

### Strategy for Working with Existing Model
Since we couldn't add new fields to WorkoutDay, we embed metadata directly in the workout text:

1. **Notes**: Added as part of workout text with "üìù Notes:" prefix
2. **Modification Reasons**: Embedded with "‚úèÔ∏è Modified:" prefix
3. **Deletion Reasons**: Stored as "Rest day - [reason]"
4. **Coach Planning**: Uses existing `isCoachPlanned` boolean

### Example Workout Formats
```swift
// Regular workout with notes
"70-min steady row @ Zone 2\n\nüìù Notes: Focus on technique"

// Modified workout
"45-min recovery bike\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Modified: Reduced from 70 min due to fatigue"

// Deleted workout
"Rest day - Feeling unwell, need recovery"
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Maximum Flexibility**: Coach can adapt day-by-day based on performance
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing data model preserved
3. **Backward Compatible**: Old `plan_week_workouts` still works
4. **Audit Trail**: Modification reasons embedded in workout text
5. **Responsive**: Immediate adaptation to athlete feedback

## Adaptive Logic

The system adapts workouts based on feedback keywords:
- **Fatigue indicators** (tired, heavy, exhausted) ‚Üí Recovery workout
- **Pain/soreness** ‚Üí Active recovery only  
- **Positive feedback** (strong, great, easy) ‚Üí Progressive workout
- **Neutral** ‚Üí Standard workout for current block

## Usage Examples

### Daily Planning Flow
```
Morning:
[TOOL_CALL: plan_workout(date: "today", workout: "70-min row")]

Evening (after completion):
[TOOL_CALL: plan_next_workout(based_on_feedback: "legs heavy")]
‚Üí Generates lighter workout for tomorrow

Next day (if feeling better):
[TOOL_CALL: update_workout(date: "today", workout: "back to normal", reason: "recovered")]
```

### Modification Tracking
All changes are tracked within the workout text itself, maintaining a history without database changes.

## Testing Status
‚úÖ All code compiles successfully
‚úÖ Build succeeds without errors
‚úÖ No data model changes required
‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing workouts

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Calendar UI could be enhanced to parse and display embedded metadata
- Could add visual indicators for modified workouts
- Could extract and display modification history from workout text
