# Proactive Messaging Critical Bug Fix

## Bug Description
The proactive messaging system was sending false messages claiming to have initialized the training program without actually executing the required tool calls.

### Symptoms
- Message: "I've initialized your 20-week training program..."
- Reality: No tool calls executed, program not actually started
- Log evidence: "Found 0 matches" for tool calls, "No current program" persists

## Root Cause
The LLM was not properly instructed to use tools before making claims about actions taken. The system prompt was too vague about the requirement to execute tools.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt in CoachBrain
Made the system prompt explicitly state:
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Never claim to have done something without using tools
- Clear decision flow: Check status → Execute tools → Send message
- Explicit examples of tool usage patterns

### 2. Updated Initial Prompt
The context prompt now:
- Emphasizes checking actual status before claims
- Provides step-by-step instructions for initialization
- Requires tool execution before message crafting

### 3. Benefits of Refactored Architecture
With the new modular design:
- **Easier to Debug**: The bug was isolated to prompt engineering in CoachBrain
- **Easier to Test**: Can mock tool responses to verify correct behavior
- **Easier to Fix**: Only needed to update prompts in one focused component

## Testing the Fix

### Unit Test Example
```swift
func testCoachBrain_NoProgramExists_MustUseToolsFirst() async throws {
    // Given
    let context = createTestContext(programExists: false)
    mockToolProcessor.shouldDetectToolCalls = true
    
    // When
    let decision = try await coachBrain.evaluateContext(context)
    
    // Then
    XCTAssertTrue(mockToolProcessor.detectedToolCalls.contains("start_training_program"))
    XCTAssertTrue(mockToolProcessor.detectedToolCalls.contains("plan_week"))
    XCTAssertTrue(decision.message?.contains("set up") ?? false)
    XCTAssertFalse(decision.message?.contains("I've initialized") ?? false) // Past tense without tool execution
}
```

### Integration Test
```swift
func testProactiveFlow_InitializesProgram() async throws {
    // Given no program exists
    TrainingScheduleManager.shared.clearProgram()
    
    // When proactive check runs
    await ProactiveScheduler.shared.triggerEvaluation()
    
    // Then program should actually be initialized
    XCTAssertNotNil(TrainingScheduleManager.shared.programStartDate)
    XCTAssertEqual(TrainingScheduleManager.shared.currentBlock?.type, .aerobicCapacity)
}
```

## Prevention Strategy

1. **Explicit Prompts**: Always specify exact tool usage requirements
2. **Verification Logic**: Add checks that claimed actions match executed tools
3. **Testing**: Include tests that verify tool execution matches message claims
4. **Monitoring**: Log tool executions vs. message content for discrepancies

## Refactoring Advantage

This bug highlights why the refactoring is valuable:
- In the monolithic version, this bug was buried in 802 lines
- In the refactored version, it's isolated to prompt engineering in CoachBrain
- The fix only required updating prompts, not touching scheduling or delivery logic
- Can now easily test this specific behavior in isolation
