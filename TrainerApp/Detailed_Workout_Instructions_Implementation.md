# Detailed Workout Instructions Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a feature allowing the coach to generate detailed workout instructions that are stored structurally on the calendar and accessible via deep links from chat, keeping conversations clean and organized.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Model Extensions
- **File**: `TrainerApp/Models/TrainingCalendar.swift`
- Added `WorkoutInstructions` struct with:
  - `generatedAt: Date` - Timestamp of generation
  - `sections: [InstructionSection]` - Flexible sections for different instruction types
- Added `InstructionSection` struct with:
  - `SectionType` enum: overview, heartRateZones, warmUp, mainSet, coolDown, technique, hydration, nutrition, recovery, alternatives, notes
  - `title: String` - Section heading
  - `content: [String]` - Array of bullet points/paragraphs
- Extended `WorkoutDay` model with `detailedInstructions: WorkoutInstructions?` field

### 2. Tool Implementation
- **File**: `TrainerApp/Services/ToolProcessor.swift`
- Added `generate_workout_instructions` tool that:
  - Generates contextual instructions based on workout type
  - Automatically includes relevant sections (HR zones for cardio, sets/reps for strength)
  - Saves instructions to the workout day
  - Returns a deep link in format: `trainer://calendar/2024-01-15`

### 3. Deep Linking System
- **Files**: `TrainerApp/TrainerAppApp.swift`, `TrainerApp/Info.plist`
- Created `NavigationState` class to manage app-wide navigation
- Implemented URL handling for `trainer://` scheme
- Registered URL scheme in Info.plist
- Navigation flow: URL â†’ Parse date â†’ Navigate to calendar â†’ Show workout detail

### 4. UI Components
- **File**: `TrainerApp/Views/WeeklyCalendarView.swift`
- Created `DetailedInstructionsCard` component with:
  - Expandable/collapsible interface
  - Formatted section display
  - Generation timestamp
  - Blue accent border for visibility
- Created `InstructionSectionView` for consistent section formatting
- Updated `WorkoutDetailSheet` to display instructions when available
- Auto-expands instructions when navigated via deep link

### 5. Visual Indicators
- **File**: `TrainerApp/Views/WeeklyCalendarView.swift`
- Added document icon (`doc.text.fill`) to day cards with instructions
- Icon appears alongside completion status indicators

### 6. Navigation Flow
- **Files**: `TrainerApp/ContentView.swift`, `TrainerApp/Views/CalendarView.swift`
- Updated ContentView to handle navigation state
- CalendarView responds to deep link navigation
- WeeklyCalendarView automatically shows target workout when navigated

### 7. Coach Integration
- **File**: `TrainerApp/SystemPrompt.md`
- Added tool documentation to coach's system prompt
- Instructed coach to use tool and provide link rather than full details in chat
- Example: "I've created detailed instructions for your 60-minute spin session. ðŸ“‹ View instructions: trainer://calendar/2024-01-15"

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Content**: Coach determines which sections to include based on workout type
2. **Clean Chat**: Instructions stored in calendar, only link shared in chat
3. **Easy Access**: One-click navigation from chat to full instructions
4. **Visual Clarity**: Instructions clearly marked in calendar with expandable cards
5. **Context-Aware**: Different instruction types for different workouts (endurance vs strength)

## Example Workflow

1. User asks: "What should I do for today's workout?"
2. Coach uses: `[TOOL_CALL: generate_workout_instructions(date: "today")]`
3. System generates detailed instructions with relevant sections
4. Coach responds: "I've prepared detailed instructions for your 60-minute easy spin bike session. ðŸ“‹ View instructions: trainer://calendar/2024-01-15"
5. User clicks link â†’ Calendar opens â†’ Workout day shows â†’ Instructions auto-expand

## Benefits

- **Organized**: Workout details stored with the workout, not scattered in chat
- **Referenceable**: Users can revisit instructions anytime from calendar
- **Coach-Driven**: AI determines appropriate level of detail
- **Clean UX**: Chat stays focused on conversation, not walls of text
