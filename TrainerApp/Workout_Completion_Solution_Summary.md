# Workout Completion Auto-Detection Solution

## Problem
When users message about completing their workout (e.g., "I finished my workout today"), the AI agent wasn't automatically logging it using the `mark_workout_complete` tool.

## Solution Overview
Enhanced the system prompt and tool implementation to automatically detect workout completions and store details separately for better data organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. System Prompt Enhancement (TrainerApp/SystemPrompt.md)
Added section 9.1 "AUTOMATIC WORKOUT LOGGING" that instructs the AI to:
- Immediately detect when an athlete reports completing a workout
- Extract workout details and store in `workout` parameter
- Extract performance notes and store in `notes` parameter
- Use the `mark_workout_complete` tool before responding
- Provide encouragement and recovery guidance after logging

### 2. Tool Implementation Enhancement (TrainerApp/Services/ToolProcessor.swift)
Updated the `mark_workout_complete` tool to:
- Accept a new `workout` parameter for storing what was actually done
- Store workout details in the `actualWorkout` field of WorkoutDay
- Keep performance notes separate in the `notes` field
- Display both in the completion confirmation

### 3. Key Design Decisions
- Leveraged LLM's natural language understanding instead of pattern matching
- Separated workout details from performance notes for better data structure
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Data Storage Structure
- **actualWorkout**: Stores what exercise was performed (e.g., "60 min steady state", "4x10min intervals")
- **notes**: Stores how it went, feelings, observations (e.g., "felt strong", "legs tired", "hit all splits")

## Benefits
1. **Natural interaction**: Users can report workouts in their own words
2. **Automatic logging**: No need to remember specific commands
3. **Structured data**: Workout details and notes stored separately for analysis
4. **Comprehensive tracking**: All details are captured from the message
5. **Immediate feedback**: Athletes get encouragement right after logging

## Example Interactions

**User**: "Just finished 60 minutes on the rower, felt great!"
**AI**: [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "today", workout: "60 minutes on the rower", notes: "felt great")]
*Then responds with*: "Great job completing your 60-minute row! Feeling great is a sign of good fitness adaptation..."

**User**: "Did my workout - 4x10min intervals at threshold, legs were tired but I hit all my splits"
**AI**: [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "today", workout: "4x10min intervals at threshold", notes: "legs were tired but hit all splits")]
*Then responds with*: "Excellent work pushing through those threshold intervals despite tired legs! Hitting your splits shows..."

**User**: "Completed today's strength session"
**AI**: [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "today", workout: "strength session")]
*Then responds with*: "Well done completing your strength work! Recovery is key after lifting..."

## Technical Details
The tool call format is:
```
[TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "date", workout: "what was done", notes: "how it went")]
```

Parameters:
- `date` (required): When the workout was done (default: "today")
- `workout` (optional): Description of the workout performed
- `notes` (optional): Performance notes, feelings, observations
