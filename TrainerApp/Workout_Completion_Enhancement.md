# Workout Completion Detection Enhancement

## Problem Statement
When athletes message about completing their workout (e.g., "I finished my workout" or "Did 60 minutes on the rower today"), the AI agent doesn't automatically log it using the `mark_workout_complete` tool.

## Solution: Enhanced System Prompt Section

Add the following section to SystemPrompt.md after section 9 (DAILY INTERACTION PROTOCOL):

```markdown
## 9.1 │ AUTOMATIC WORKOUT COMPLETION DETECTION

### 9.1.1 │ TRIGGER PATTERNS
When athlete sends ANY message containing workout completion indicators, IMMEDIATELY use [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete]:

• Completion phrases: "finished", "completed", "done with", "did my", "just did", "wrapped up"
• Past tense exercise mentions: "rowed", "lifted", "ran", "biked", "worked out"
• Duration indicators: "X minutes/hours of", "spent X on"
• Effort descriptions: "went hard", "easy session", "crushed it", "tough workout"

### 9.1.2 │ INFORMATION EXTRACTION
From athlete's message, extract and include in tool call:
1. Date: Default to "today" unless specific date mentioned
2. Workout details → store in actualWorkout field
3. Performance notes → store in notes field

### 9.1.3 │ EXECUTION FLOW
1. Detect workout completion indicator in message
2. Extract available information
3. IMMEDIATELY call: [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "today", notes: "extracted info")]
4. Acknowledge completion with encouragement
5. Provide recovery/nutrition guidance based on workout type

### 9.1.4 │ EXAMPLES

Athlete: "Just finished 70 minutes steady state, felt good"
→ [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "today", notes: "70 minutes steady state, felt good")]

Athlete: "Crushed the intervals today! Hit all my splits"
→ [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "today", notes: "Completed intervals, hit all target splits")]

Athlete: "Did my workout - 4x10min pieces at threshold"
→ [TOOL_CALL: mark_workout_complete(date: "today", notes: "4x10min at threshold")]

### 9.1.5 │ PRIORITY RULE
Workout completion detection takes PRIORITY over conversational response. Always log first, then respond.
```

## Implemented Changes

### 1. System Prompt Enhancement
Added section 9.1 to SystemPrompt.md with simplified automatic workout logging instructions:
- When athlete reports completing a workout, immediately use mark_workout_complete tool
- Extract date, workout details, and notes from their message
- Log first, then respond with encouragement

### 2. Tool Enhancement (To be implemented in Code mode)

The `mark_workout_complete` tool needs to be enhanced to properly store workout details:

**In ToolProcessor.swift (lines 135-140)**, the tool case handler needs updating:
```swift
case "mark_workout_complete":
    print("✅ ToolProcessor: Matched mark_workout_complete tool")
    let dateParam = toolCall.parameters["date"] as? String ?? "today"
    let notesParam = toolCall.parameters["notes"] as? String
    // No changes needed here - the notes field can contain all workout info
    let result = try await executeMarkWorkoutComplete(date: dateParam, notes: notesParam)
    return ToolCallResult(toolName: toolCall.name, result: result)
```

**The executeMarkWorkoutComplete method (line 418)** already stores notes properly:
```swift
workoutDay.notes = notes
```

The key insight is that we can use the existing `notes` parameter to store all workout information. The AI will combine workout details and any performance notes into a single comprehensive notes string.

## Testing Scenarios

Test these user messages to verify automatic workout logging:

1. Simple completions:
   - "Just finished my workout"
   - "Done!"
   - "Workout complete"

2. With details:
   - "Completed 60 min steady state at 135-145 bpm"
   - "Did 4x10min intervals at threshold pace"
   - "Finished today's session - 70 minutes UT2"

3. With performance notes:
   - "Crushed the intervals today! Hit all my splits"
   - "Rowed for 45 minutes, felt tired in the last 10"
   - "Finished - back was tight on squats but pushed through"

4. Past tense variations:
   - "I rowed for an hour this morning"
   - "Did my workout earlier"
   - "Completed the strength session yesterday"

## Key Benefits

1. **Natural Language**: Athletes can report workouts however feels natural
2. **Automatic Logging**: No need to remember specific commands
3. **Detail Preservation**: All workout information is captured in notes
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Athletes get encouragement right after logging

## Implementation Status

- ✅ System prompt updated with automatic logging instructions
- ✅ Existing tool infrastructure supports the enhancement
- ⏳ Testing needed to verify LLM properly detects workout completions
- ⏳ May need minor adjustments based on real-world usage
