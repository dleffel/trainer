# Phase Awareness Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
The coach AI was not considering which part of the macro cycle (training phase) the athlete was in when planning workouts, potentially suggesting endurance work during strength phases or vice versa.

## Solution Implemented
Ultra-simple phase awareness through minimal code changes and smart prompting.

## Changes Made

### 1. ToolProcessor.swift Changes
**File**: `TrainerApp/TrainerApp/Services/ToolProcessor.swift`

#### Modified `executeGetTrainingStatus()` (Line 431-437)
```swift
// OLD:
return """
[Training Status]
• Current Block: \(block.type.rawValue.capitalized) (Week \(week) of \(block.type.duration))
• Overall Progress: Week \(totalWeek) of 20
• Today: \(day.name)
• Focus: \(getBlockFocus(block.type))
"""

// NEW:
return """
[Training Status]
• Current Block: \(block.type.rawValue.capitalized) (Week \(week) of \(block.type.duration))
• Overall Progress: Week \(totalWeek) of 20
• Today: \(day.name)

Plan a workout appropriate for \(block.type.rawValue) Week \(week).
"""
```

#### Removed Unused Helper Function (Lines 767-778)
- Deleted the `getBlockFocus()` helper function as it's no longer needed

### 2. SystemPrompt.md Changes
**File**: `TrainerApp/TrainerApp/SystemPrompt.md`

#### Added Section 9.5: Phase-Aware Workout Planning
```markdown
## 9.5 │ PHASE-AWARE WORKOUT PLANNING

**Critical Rule**: ALWAYS check [TOOL_CALL: get_training_status] before planning any workout.
The system will tell you which training block and week you're in.
Plan workouts that are appropriate for that specific phase and week of training.

Your training blocks are:
- Hypertrophy-Strength (Weeks 1-10): Focus on building strength
- Deload (Week 11): Recovery week, reduce volume by 30%
- Aerobic-Capacity (Weeks 12-19): Focus on endurance
- Deload (Week 20): Final recovery week

The specific workout you plan should match the current block's training goals.
```

## How It Works

1. **Coach checks training status** → Gets current block and week
2. **Tool response includes reminder** → "Plan a workout appropriate for [Phase] Week [X]"
3. **System prompt reinforces rule** → Always check status before planning
4. **AI understands context** → Plans phase-appropriate workouts

## Example Interaction

**Before Implementation:**
```
Coach: [TOOL_CALL: get_training_status]
Response: "Current Block: Hypertrophy-Strength (Week 7 of 10)"
Coach: "Let's do a 70-minute Zone 2 row today" ❌ (Wrong phase!)
```

**After Implementation:**
```
Coach: [TOOL_CALL: get_training_status]
Response: "Current Block: Hypertrophy-Strength (Week 7 of 10)
          Plan a workout appropriate for Hypertrophy-Strength Week 7."
Coach: "Since we're in Week 7 of Strength block, let's do heavy squats: 3x5 @ 85%" ✅
```

## Benefits

1. **Minimal code changes** - Only 2 lines modified, 1 function removed
2. **No hard-coded logic** - AI understands phases naturally
3. **Flexible and adaptive** - Coach can still personalize within phase guidelines
4. **Clear reminders** - Every status check includes phase context
5. **Future-proof** - Easy to adjust by updating prompt, not code

## Testing Recommendations

1. Ask for workouts during different phases:
   - Week 7 (Strength) → Should suggest heavy lifts
   - Week 11 (Deload) → Should reduce volume
   - Week 15 (Aerobic) → Should suggest endurance work

2. Verify the coach mentions the current phase when planning

3. Check that deload weeks properly reduce volume by 30%

## Total Implementation Time

- Code changes: 3 minutes
- System prompt update: 2 minutes
- Build verification: 5 minutes
- **Total: 10 minutes**

This elegant solution ensures the coach always considers the current training phase without adding complexity or rigid rules to the system.
