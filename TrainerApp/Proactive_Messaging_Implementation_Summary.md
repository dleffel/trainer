# Proactive Messaging Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We've transformed your rowing coach from a purely reactive chat interface into a proactive training companion that intelligently sends reminders and check-ins based on context.

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **LLM-Driven Decision Making**
   - Every 30 minutes (configurable), the coach wakes up and evaluates whether to send a message
   - The LLM considers current time, day, workout status, and recent interactions
   - No rigid rules - the coach uses its intelligence to decide what's appropriate

2. **Smart Context Awareness**
   - Knows if you've completed today's workout
   - Tracks when you last opened the app
   - Remembers when it last sent a message
   - Considers your current training block and week

3. **User Controls**
   - Toggle smart reminders on/off
   - Set check frequency (15-120 minutes)
   - Configure quiet hours (e.g., 10 PM - 6 AM)
   - Limit daily messages (1-10)
   - Enable/disable Sunday weekly reviews

4. **Message Suppression**
   - Won't message during quiet hours
   - Won't exceed daily message limit
   - Won't message if you opened the app recently (15 min)
   - Won't send messages too close together (1 hour minimum)

## How It Works

### Background Process Flow:
```
Timer (30 min) â†’ Gather Context â†’ Ask LLM â†’ Decision â†’ Send/Skip â†’ Repeat
```

### Example LLM Evaluation:
**Context**: Tuesday 7:30 AM, Upper body workout planned, not completed
**LLM Decision**: "Send a reminder - it's 30 minutes before typical workout time"
**Message**: "Good morning! Ready for today's Upper Body work? Floor press 4Ã—6..."

## Files Created/Modified:

1. **ProactiveCoachManager.swift** - Core manager handling all proactive logic
2. **ProactiveMessagingSettingsView.swift** - Settings UI
3. **TrainerAppApp.swift** - App initialization and background task setup
4. **ContentView.swift** - Settings integration
5. **Info.plist** - Background task permissions

## Testing the Implementation:

### 1. Initial Setup:
- Build and run the app
- Go to Settings â†’ Smart Reminders
- Ensure "Enable Smart Reminders" is ON
- Tap "Test Proactive Message" to trigger an immediate evaluation

### 2. Testing Scenarios:

**Morning Reminder Test:**
- Set device time to 30 minutes before a typical workout
- Wait for background task or tap "Test Proactive Message"
- Should receive a pre-workout reminder

**Missed Workout Check-in:**
- Set time to afternoon with morning workout not completed
- Trigger evaluation
- Should receive a gentle check-in

**Sunday Review:**
- Set date/time to Sunday evening
- Trigger evaluation
- Should receive weekly summary

**Suppression Test:**
- Open the app, then immediately test
- Should NOT receive a message (recent app open)

### 3. Debug Output:
The console will show:
```
ðŸ¤– ProactiveCoachManager Decision:
   Time: Aug 30, 7:30 AM
   Send: Yes
   Reasoning: Morning workout reminder appropriate
   Message: [actual message content]
```

## Configuration Options:

### Default Settings:
- Check every 30 minutes
- Max 3 messages per day
- Quiet hours: 10 PM - 6 AM
- Sunday review at 7 PM

### Customization:
Users can adjust all settings through the UI to match their preferences and workout patterns.

## Privacy & Battery:

- All decisions happen on-device
- Efficient background task scheduling
- Respects iOS background execution limits
- No tracking or external data storage

## Future Enhancements:

1. **Learning Mode**: Track which messages get positive responses
2. **Calendar Integration**: Check for scheduled events before messaging
3. **Weather Awareness**: Adjust outdoor workout reminders based on conditions
4. **Achievement Celebrations**: Proactive congratulations for milestones
5. **Adaptive Timing**: Learn actual workout times over weeks

## Troubleshooting:

If notifications aren't working:
1. Check iOS Settings â†’ Notifications â†’ Trainer (ensure allowed)
2. Verify background app refresh is enabled
3. Check quiet hours settings
4. Look for suppression reasons in console output

The system is designed to be helpful without being annoying, using the coach's intelligence to send the right message at the right time.
